I"œ<blockquote>
  <p>A Julia package that provides tools for defining observation schemes for stochastic processes in a systematic manner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The principal idea behind <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffusionBayes/ObservationSchemes.jl">ObservationSchemes.jl</a> is to</p>
<ol>
  <li>provide structs (currently <code class="highlighter-rouge">LinearGsnObs</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">GeneralObs</code>) that can decorate each observation separately with the information about how each particular datapoint was collected</li>
  <li>provide a collection struct (<code class="highlighter-rouge">AllObservations</code>) that collects
    <ul>
      <li>the decorated data</li>
      <li>together with the information about the laws of the underlying stochastic processes</li>
      <li>and the dependence structure between various laws (so as to facilitate working with mixed effect models)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It is a part of a larger suite of packages <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffusionBayes">JuliaDiffusionBayes</a>â€”a collection of efficient and intuitive tools for performing Bayesian inference for diffusion processes.</p>
