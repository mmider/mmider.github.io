  <p>A Julia package that makes it easy to define diffusion processes and sample from their laws.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffusionBayes/DiffusionDefinition.jl">DiffusionDefinition.jl</a> comprises of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>convenient methods facilitating
    <ul>
      <li>defining diffusion laws</li>
      <li>forward-sampling their trajectories</li>
      <li>computing functionals of sampled paths</li>
      <li>computing gradients of functionals of sampled paths with respect to diffusion parameters or with respect to the starting point of the trajectory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A number of predefined diffusion processes that can be immediately loaded in and experimented on</li>
</ul>

<p>It is designed to work efficiently in a setting of Bayesian inference for diffusion processes.</p>

<p>It is a part of a larger suite of packages <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffusionBayes">JuliaDiffusionBayes</a>â€”a collection of efficient and intuitive tools for performing Bayesian inference for diffusion processes.</p>
