<blockquote>
  <p>We correct an error in Theorem 2.1 in <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bj/1393594001">Bladt and SÃ¸rensen (2014)</a>, where the initial distribution of an auxiliary diffusion process that is used to describe the distribution of the proposed approximate diffusion bridge is wrong. As a consequence, we also correct the pseudo marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that has an exact diffusion bridge as its target distribution. The same auxiliary diffusion plays a central role in the algorithm.</p>
