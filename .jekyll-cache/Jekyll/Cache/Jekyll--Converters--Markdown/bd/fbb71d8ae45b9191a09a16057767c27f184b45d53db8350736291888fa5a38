<p>My name is Marcin and I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences</a>. My research focuses on developing efficient, robust and scalable statistical methods for various problems involving stochastic processes. I completed my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/jenkins/">Dr Paul Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/pollock/">Dr Murray Pollock</a> and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/roberts/">Prof Gareth Roberts</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.oxwasp-cdt.ac.uk/">OxWaSP programme</a>â€”a centre for doctoral training (CDT) programme run jointly by the University of Warwick and the University of Oxford. Previously, I studied at the University of Warwick, where I obtained a degree of <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/courses/morse/">Bachelor of Science and Master of Mathematics, Operational Research, Statistics and Economics (MORSE)</a>.</p>
