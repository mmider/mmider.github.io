This is a corrigendum to a paper originally authored by [Michael Sørensen](http://web.math.ku.dk/~michael/) and [Mogens Bladt](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/about/news/new-names/mogens-bladt-professor/).

Abstract
----
> We correct an error in Theorem 2.1 in [Bladt and Sørensen (2014)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bj/1393594001), where the initial distribution of an auxiliary diffusion process that is used to describe the distribution of the proposed approximate diffusion bridge is wrong. As a consequence, we also correct the pseudo marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that has an exact diffusion bridge as its target distribution. The same auxiliary diffusion plays a central role in the algorithm.
